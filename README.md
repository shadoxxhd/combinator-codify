# Combinator Codify
A mod for the game Factorio, providing a text interface to edit the code of a combinator

This mod creates a new GUI alongside the combinator settings GUI. The new GUI has a text field containing a lua table representation of the settings of the combinator as they would be stored in a blueprint. That text can be edited and applied to the combinator, making it easy to duplicate conditions and perform other complex operations.
